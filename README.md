# Welcome to AcmePos

AcmePos is a command-line POS.

Its purpose is to demonstrate to a POS software developer how they might integrate with a PIN pad (card payment terminal) using Assembly Payment's SPI (Simple Payments Integration) as documented at [harness.simplepaymentapi.com](harness.simplepaymentapi.com).

This project is sample code that implements the SPI protocol. It is not complete and is up to you to enhance and change to make it work on your target platform.

# Setup

This implementation uses the NuGet [SPIClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SPIClient/) library to integrate with Assembly Payments' instore terminals.
